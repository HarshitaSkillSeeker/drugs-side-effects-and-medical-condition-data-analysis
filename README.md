# Drug, Side Effects & Medical Conditions Analysis

This project analyzes relationships between drugs, their associated side effects, medical conditions, and user ratings using Python and Tableau.

---

## Objective

To perform data analytics on a drug dataset and extract insights for:
- Most common drug classes and medical conditions
- Frequent and severe side effects
- User review ratings and correlations
- Alcohol & pregnancy safety classifications

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- VS Code Notebook
- Tableau Public (Interactive Dashboard)
- GitHub
